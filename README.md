# Reference Genome Comparison
This repository contains both linear and graph alignment workflows for the thesis "Evaluating Pangenome Reference Graph Potential for Transcriptomic Research: A Focus on Tools and Resources". Which is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lNPg6bzlsP5YuTyrHJCpDgTeg3zFJ2NwPBPi52pgEw/edit?usp=sharing

Linear reference workflow and subsequent analysis can be found in the star_t2d directory. 

Graph reference workflow and subsequent analysis can be found in the vgrna_t2d directory. 

Both workflows are a re-analysis of the RNA-Seq samples from BioProject PRJNA762935.

### An important note to readers:
The code in these workflows is ad hoc and intended to be a raw representation of the trials and errors of this study. As such, file paths and some rules in the Snakefiles and R Markdown analyses would need to be adjusted for use on other user's systems.
